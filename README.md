# Routing Visualizer using Vue, Vuetify and Leaflet

# Description

This is a simple project where you can see how to:

- Use Vue 2, Nuxt.js and Vuetify together to create a map project
- Load a JSON file using the file selector
- Show the JSON contents on a Leaflet map
- Filter the data showed on the map using a v-selector

The data on the JSON tries to represent imaginary routes. On each route you can find stops.
Everything starts on an imaginary origin point.

Look inside the `static` folder to locate the JSON.

## Build Setup

$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
